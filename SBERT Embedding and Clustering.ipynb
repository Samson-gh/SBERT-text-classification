    "\n",
    "BERT when it was introduced was by far the most successful model built for general tasks involving semantic textual simlilarity however finding embedding representations for large chunks of text like sentences or paragraphs was a task that in reality is quite different from the simple word embeddings generated from models like BERT, GloVe, Word2Vec, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "A representation that takes into account the context of the information throughout the entire piece of text required adaptations to current models to take word vector representations and produce a richer representation that generates an embedding based on similarity between large chunks of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "SBERT is such an adaptation ontop of the BERT model. It utilizes twin BERT networks as well as a set of new objective funtions to optimize similarity measures between pairs of sentences in addition to a number of techniques like masking to achieve notable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit to this model in this particular use is that the pretrained models are small enough and efficient enough to fit directly on a single computer and run off its own memory and compute power. The openai embedding models which are based roughly on a similar set of principles require sending data to its servers through an API. Not an ideal situation when sensitive data is being transferred and processed."
